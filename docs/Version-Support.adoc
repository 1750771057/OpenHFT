= Version Support
Peter Lawrey

Chronicle Software supports each version for two years from the start of the next minor version. 

All our software has a MAJOR.STAGE.MINOR version. 

The MAJOR version is the generation of the software, where major versions are not compatible with each other.

The STAGE version is the same for all our products e.g 2.17.x or 3.17.x so you know that all the software is part of the same stage.

The MINOR version is the incremental release of the software for a given MAJOR.STAGE.

Once a MAJOR.STAGE is updated to the new version, the previous MAJOR.STAGE-1 starts two years until end of support.

=== Commercial Support Agreement

A commercial support agreement is available from mailto:sales@chronicle.software[sales@chronicle.software], free open source support is also available but on a best efforts basis. Free support issues are not treated as a high priority unless the issues also affect organisations with a commercial agreement. The support agreement doesnâ€™t just benefit your organisation but it helps the wider community as it allows us to fund the continued development of our OpenSource libraries.
